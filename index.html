                    <article class="about-card">
                        <p> Ever since I was kid I remember that I always wanted to be in the tech industry,
                         especially as an executive. I always wanted to learn about computers and how they work,
                         and then use that to change the world. As I grew older my curiosity for computers and business never ended. I started to learn about companies and management, as well as how to apply computer systems to benefit society.
                         Most Universities ask that you chose one major, I couldn’t settle on limiting myself so I decided to do both.
                         I major in Computer Science and Business Finance.
                         The interpersonal, and management skills I’ve learned from my B.B.A. classes gives me the ability to communicate and work effectively in a team.
                         And the skills I’ve developed from Computer Science classes, have given me a tool in creating the future I desire. I look forward to always learning and never satiating my curiosity.
                         So feel free to <a href="#contact"><span>contact me</span></a>, I hope to hear from you soon!

                                <p>Riai is a financial services website that I am currently building.
                                It uses machine learning on gathered stock fundamentals
                                and market sentiment data to predict future profitability.
                                I've worked on all parts of the website using it to
                                grow my finance and programming skills. </p>

                                other users that follow those categories. It also pulls from the
                                web to show users a daily dose of cute animal pictures.</p>
